          HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
          display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such
          as
          <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"
            title="The HTML <head> element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets."

        <h2 class="title">Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the
          concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year
          through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally
          specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0
          in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In
          1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2
          recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became
          an ISO standard in 2000.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML,
          prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004.
          Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations
          released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

          Concept and syntax
        </h2>
        <p>
          An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements.
          Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag
          begins and ends with angle brackets (<>). There are a few empty or
          void tags that cannot enclose any text.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional
          information affecting how the browser interprets the element:
