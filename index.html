          HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
          display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such
          as
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>

          In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the
          concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year
          through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally
          specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0
          in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In
          1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2
          recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became
          an ISO standard in 2000.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML,
          prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004.
          Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations
          released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

          An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements.
          Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag
          begins and ends with angle brackets (<>). There are a few empty or
          void tags that cannot enclose any text.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional
          information affecting how the browser interprets the element:

        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

        <h1 class="title">Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          The anatomy of our element is:
        <br>
        The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
        The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
        The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

        <h1 class="title">Nesting Elements</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting.

        <h1 class="title">Block versus inline elements</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content. (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content) An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text. For example, as an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section id="Whitespace_in_HTML" class="main-section">
        <header>
        <h1 class="title">Whitespace in HTML</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability.
        <br>
        It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted. In our HTML we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example), but you should consider formatting it.
        </p>

        <section id="HTML_comments" class="main-section">
          <header>
        <h1 class="title">HTML comments</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments,  effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.
          To write an HTML&nbsp;comment, wrap it in the special markers <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>
